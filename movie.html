<h2>About</h2>

<p> District 9 was one of the finest science fiction movies of its time. It shook the world when it came out, and got a lot
of love from the audience. It was because we never expected anything like it. It was unlike any other movie that came
before it. And it surpassed all expectations in terms of the content that a science fiction movie can offer. One might
have an expectation of a proper fictional story from such a film that has no basis in reality. But that was hardly the
case with District 9, which was way ahead of its time and was a subtle jab at the problems and tribulations faced by
people, and a subtle hint at the reality of things. </p>
